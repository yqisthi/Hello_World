# TensorFlow
Machine learning is very complex. But implementing machine learning models is far less daunting and difficult than it used to be, 
thanks to machine learning frameworks such as Google’s TensorFlow that ease the process of acquiring data, training models, serving predictions, and refining future results.
Created by the Google, TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. 
TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning models and algorithms and makes them useful.

# How TensorFlow Works?
TensorFlow allows developers to create dataflow graphs—structures that describe how data moves through a graph, or a series of processing nodes. 
Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation, and each connection or edge between nodes is a multidimensional data array, or tensor.

TensorFlow provides all of this for the programmer by way of the Python language. 
Python is easy to learn and work with, and provides convenient ways to express how high-level abstractions can be coupled together. 
Nodes and tensors in TensorFlow are Python objects, and TensorFlow applications are themselves Python applications.

The actual math operations, however, are not performed in Python. 
The libraries of transformations that are available through TensorFlow are written as high-performance C++ binaries. 
Python just directs traffic between the pieces, and provides high-level programming abstractions to hook them together.

TensorFlow applications can be run on most any target that’s convenient: a local machine, a cluster in the cloud, iOS and Android devices, CPUs or GPUs. 
If you use Google’s own cloud, you can run TensorFlow on Google’s custom TensorFlow Processing Unit (TPU) silicon for further acceleration. 
The resulting models created by TensorFlow, though, can be deployed on most any device where they will be used to serve predictions.

# TensorFlow Benefits
TensorFlow offers additional conveniences for developers who need to debug and gain introspection into TensorFlow apps. 
The eager execution mode lets you evaluate and modify each graph operation separately and transparently, 
instead of constructing the entire graph as a single opaque object and evaluating it all at once. 
The TensorBoard visualization suite lets you inspect and profile the way graphs run by way of an interactive, web-based dashboard.

TensorFlow also gains many advantages from the backing of an A-list commercial outfit in Google. 
Google has not only fueled the rapid pace of development behind the project, but created many significant offerings around TensorFlow that 
make it easier to deploy and easier to use: the above-mentioned TPU silicon for accelerated performance in Google’s cloud; an online hub for 
sharing models created with the framework; in-browser and mobile-friendly incarnations of the framework; and much more.
